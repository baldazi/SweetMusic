## Downloading / Setting data :

### Downloading :

With this app you can download the current state of your data (in the main menu, swiping left to right from the border of the screen shows a sliding menu).
Downloading the data of the app will save two files :

- allMusics.musics : a file that contains all the infos about your musics
- allPlaylists.playlists : a file that contains all the infos about your playlists

It's an interesting tool when you want to be sure that you have a backup of your infos (not the songs themselves but the infos about them (album, name, artist, album)) 
Those files will be downloaded inside your Download folder.

### Setting :
If you have already downloaded your data, you can set it in the sliding menu.
It will write over the songs and playlists infos that is currently used in the app by using the infos given by your files.

Those functionalities will be developed in the future to give the user the possibility to retrieve the infos of his songs and apply them in an other device (example : when you change your phone for a new one and you don't want to set your song's infos manually)
